- Fixing leading and trailing zeroes
- Delimiters for word automata
- Drawing automata and word automata
- Reversing automata
- Bug fixes and performance improvements


# Help documentation

Walnut now provides built-in documentation for all commands using the `help` command. To view all commands for which documentation exists, one writes:
```
help;
```

To view documentation for a specific command, one writes:
```
help <command>;
```


# Automata operations

One can now perform basic automata operations. The operations, along with their commands, are:

 - Union of automata, using the `union` command
 - Intersection of automata, using the `intersect` command
 - Kleene star of automata, using the `star` command
 - Concatenation of automata, using the `concat` command
 - Left quotient of automata, using the `leftquo` command
 - Right quotient of automata, using the `rightquo` command
 - Set the alphabet or number system of automata, using the `alphabet` command
 
 
## Union of automata

The syntax for the `union` command is as follows:
```
union <new> <old1> [old2] [old3] ... [oldN]
```

The `union` command requires at least one input automaton. All automata must have the same input alphabet.

For example, to take the union `res` of automata named `a1` and `a2` both saved in `Automata Library/`, one uses the following command:
```
union res a1 a2;
```
The resulting automaton `res` is saved in `Automata Library/`, and accepts the union of the inputs accepted by `a1` and `a2`.


## Intersection of automata

The syntax for the `intersect` command is as follows:
```
intersect <new> <old1> [old2] [old3] ... [oldN]
```

The `intersect` command requires at least one input automaton. All automata must have the same input alphabet.

For example, to take the intersection `res` of automata named `a1` and `a2` both saved in `Automata Library/`, one uses the following command:
```
intersect res a1 a2;
```
The resulting automaton `res` is saved in `Automata Library/`, and accepts the intersection of the inputs accepted by `a1` and `a2`.


## Kleene star of automata

The syntax for the `star` command is as follows:
```
star <new> <old>
```
For example, to take the Kleene star `res` of the automaton `aut` saved in `Automata Library/`, one uses the following command:
```
star res aut;
```
The resulting automaton `res` is saved in `Automata Library/`, and accepts the Kleene star of the inputs accepted by `aut`.

NOTE: The alphabet of the resulting automaton `res` will be changed if one of the input alphabets of `aut` is not a set alphabet (i.e. {0, 1}) or of the form `msd_k` or `lsd_k`. Use the `alphabet` command to force an alphabet on the resulting automaton. For example, if `aut` is an `msd_fib` automaton, `res` will be an `msd_2` automaton.


## Concatenation of automata

The syntax for the `concat` command is as follows:
```
concat <new> <old1> <old2> [old3] ... [oldN]
```
The `concat` command requires at least two input automata. All automata must have the same input alphabet.

For example, to take the concatenation `res` of automata named `a1`, `a2`, `a3` and `a4`, all saved in `Automata Library/`, one uses the following command:
```
concat res a1 a2 a3 a4;
```
The resulting automaton `res` is saved in `Automata Library/`, and accepts the concatenation of the inputs accepted by `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4`.

NOTE: The alphabet of the resulting automaton `res` will be changed if one of the input alphabets of the input automata is not a set alphabet (i.e. {0, 1}) or of the form `msd_k` or `lsd_k`. Use the `alphabet` command to force an alphabet on the resulting automaton. For example, if `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` above are `msd_fib` automata, `res` will be an `msd_2` automaton.


## Left quotient of automata

The left quotient of two automata `M1` and `M2` is defined to be the automaton that accepts the left quotient `L2\L1 = {w | exists x in L2 : xw is in L1}`, where `L1` and `L2` are the languages accepted by `M1` and `M2` respectively.

The syntax for the `leftquo` command is as follows:
```
leftquo <new> <old1> <old2>
```
For example, to take the left quotient `res` of automata named `a1` and `a2` all saved in `Automata Library/`, one uses the following command:
```
leftquo res a1 a2;
```
The resulting automaton `res` is saved in `Automata Library/`.


## Right quotient of automata

The right quotient of two automata `M1` and `M2` is defined to be the automaton that accepts the right quotient `L1/L2 = {w | exists x in L2 : wx is in L1}`, where `L1` and `L2` are the languages accepted by `M1` and `M2` respectively.

The syntax for the `rightquo` command is as follows:
```
rightquo <new> <old1> <old2>
```
For example, to take the right quotient `res` of automata named `a1` and `a2` all saved in `Automata Library/`, one uses the following command:
```
rightquo res a1 a2;
```
The resulting automaton `res` is saved in `Automata Library/`.


## Setting the number system of automata

The syntax for the `alphabet` command is as follows:
```
alphabet <new> <alphabet1> [alphabet2] ... [alphabetN] <old>
```
The alphabet of the resulting automaton `<new>` is set to the input alphabets, and all invalid transitions are removed from the new automaton.

The number of alphabets in the command must equal to the number of input alphabets of the `<old>` automaton.

For example, if `aut` (saved in `Automata Library/`) has the alphabets `msd_2 msd_2 msd_fib`, to set its alphabets to `msd_fib msd_fib msd_4`, one writes
```
alphabet res msd_2 msd_2 msd_fib aut;
```
The resulting automaton `res` is saved in `Automata Library/`.


# Fixing leading and trailing zeroes

One can now "fix" leading and trailing zeroes for Automata (not Word Automata) using the "fixleadzero" and "fixtrailzero" commands. The syntax is as follows: for an automaton "foo" saved in "Automata Library/", one writes
```
fixleadzero bar foo;
```

The resulting automaton bar accepts an input 0* x' if and only if foo accepts an input x, where x' is x with its leading zeroes removed.


Similarly, for trailing zeroes, one writes
```
fixtrailzero bar foo;
```

The resulting automaton bar accepts an input x' 0* if and only if foo accepts an input x, where x' is x with its trailing zeroes removed.


For both cases, the resulting automaton "bar" will be saved in the "Automata Library/" directory.


# Delimiters for Word Automata

In previous versions of Walnut, word automata names could not begin with A, E, or I. This restriction has now been lifted using a new delimiter for word automata: putting "." (without quotation marks) before the name of a word automaton now signals that the following string of characters is the name of the word automaton. 

If there is a word automaton named AUTOMATON, you can write ".AUTOMATON" (without quotation marks) to refer to it in eval/def commands. For example, the following is now valid:
```
def test ".AUTOMATON[n] = @1";
```
    
	
# Drawing automata and word automata

The new `draw` command creates a `.gv` file from the `.txt` definition of a Word Automaton saved in `Word Automata Library/`, or of an ordinary automaton saved in `Automata Library/`.

The syntax for the `draw` command for Word Automata is as follows:
```
draw <name>
```

For ordinary automata, prepend the `$` symbol to the automaton name:
```
draw $<name>
```

For example, to draw a Word Automaton named `AUT` saved in `Word Automata Library/`, one writes
```
draw AUT;
```
This will save the file `AUT.gv` in `Result/`.

To draw an automaton named `aut` saved in `Automata Library/`, one writes
```
draw $aut;
```
This will save the file `aut.gv` in `Result/`.


# Reversing automata

One can now use the "reverse" command to reverse ordinary automata saved in the "Automata Library/" directory.

To reverse Automata, one prepends the "$" symbol (without the quotation marks) to the old Automaton's name. The result will be saved in the "Automata Library/" directory.

For example, to reverse an Automaton named "foo" saved in "Automata Library/", one writes

	reverse bar $foo;

The resulting automaton bar will be saved in "Automata Library/".


# Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the resulting Word Automaton after running the "combine" command was not totalized
- Fixed a bug where reversing an automaton that does not have a number system (i.e. uses {0, 1} as a number system) will throw an error
- Fixed a bug where whitespace and new lines in regular expressions could result in differing automata
- Fixed a bug where using the `combine` command on one automaton would not totalize the resulting Word Automaton and apply the valid representations


# Performance improvements
- Significant memory and time improvements; thanks to John Nicol for his contributions!
- Multiplication has been drastically sped up
