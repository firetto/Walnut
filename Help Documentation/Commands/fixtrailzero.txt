The syntax for the "fixtrailzero" command is as follows:

	fixtrailzero <new> <old>

The automaton <old> should be saved in "Automata Library/" and be a regular automaton (not a Word Automaton).

The resulting automaton <new> accepts an input x' 0* if and only if <old> accepts an input x, where x' is x with its trailing zeroes removed.

For example, if "aut" is saved in "Automata Library/", one writes
	
	fixtrailzero res aut;
	
Then the resulting automaton "res" is saved in "Automata Library/".
